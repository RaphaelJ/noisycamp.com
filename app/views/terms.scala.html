    <h2 id="studio-registration">Studio registration</h2>

    <p>Studio owners can freely register their music studios through the website. Studio owners are required to
        provide
        valid and up to date information about their studios (e.g. location, opening times, pricing).</p>
    <p>NoisyCamp reserves the right to remove, without notice, any studio that would not respect the terms of
        service, or
        that would fail to deliver a quality service to its customers.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="booking">Booking</h2>

    <p>NoisyCamp provides online services to facilitate the booking of sessions from music studios.
    </p>
    <p>NoisyCamp acts as a proxy between the studio and its customers. NoisyCamp, its affiliates or employees
        disclaim all
        liability for any harm or damage that could occur before, during or after a session. Harm and damage include
        (but
        are not limited to):</p>

    <ul>
        <li>damage to any equipment.</li>
        <li>damage to the studio premises.</li>
        <li>harm incurred to the studio business and its profits.</li>
        <li>harm incurred to the physical integrity of the people involved. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Customers agree to comply with the studio rules and terms for the duration of the session.</p>

    <h3 id="online-bookings">Online bookings</h3>

    <p>Only registered NoisyCamp users can book studios sessions through the website.</p>
    <p>All bookings will be attributed a unique booking number that will be shared between the customer and the
        studio
        owner.</p>
    <p>Studio owners will be notified of new booking requests by email, and through the website interface.
    </p>
    <p>If the studio owner chooses to not automatically accept booking requests, all bookings will have to be accepted or
        rejected
        before the sessions start. A booking will be automatically rejected if not accepted before the session
        starts. Any
        online payment associated with a rejected booking will be automatically refunded.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="online-card-payments">Online card payments</h2>

    <p>Studio owners can choose to accept online card payments for the bookings made on their respective
        studios.</p>
    <p>Online card payments are processed by Stripe Payments Europe, Ltd (&quot;Stripe&quot;), our third-party
        payment
        partner.</p>
    <p>Studio owners who wish to accept online card payments have to go through the Stripe Connect onboarding
        process for
        Express accounts. This might include providing some information and documents to verify the studio
        owner&#39;s
        identity and place of residence.</p>
    <p>The use of online card payments is subject to the <a href="https://stripe.com/en-be/connect-account/legal">Stripe
            Connect terms of service</a>.</p>
    <p>The currency used to complete the payment is determined by the location of the studio. The customer&#39;s
        bank might
        choose to apply additional currency conversion fee if their bank account does not match the payment
        currency.</p>
    <p>A transaction fee will be collected on online payments, and subtracted to the studio&#39;s original
        price. The
        transaction fee equals @{(Plan.Free.transactionRate * 100).toIntExact}% of the booking total for
        <em>Free</em>
        accounts, @{(Plan.Standard.transactionRate * 100).toIntExact}% for <em>Standard</em> accounts, and @{(Plan.Premium.transactionRate * 100).toIntExact}% for <em>Premium</em> accounts. The
        transaction fee is directly charged to the customer by NoisyCamp, and NoisyCamp will take care of any
        fiscal
        obligations on this transaction fee (e.g. VAT or sale tax). The transaction fee should thus not appear in
        studio
        owners&#39; bookkeeping records.</p>
    <p>As an example, a <em>Premium</em> studio owner would observe a $2 transaction fee on a $50 online paid
        booking, and
        would thus receive a $48 transfer on their bank account. The studio owner would only be responsible of
        fiscal
        obligations on the received $48 income.</p>

    <h3 id="payment-payouts">Payment payouts</h3>

    <p>Payments collected through online card payments (minus transaction fees) are accumulated on the
        studio owner&#39;s
        Stripe account before being transferred to the desired bank account (&quot;payout&quot;). Stripe and
        the studio
        owner&#39;s bank might apply some additional fees if the bank account&#39;s currency does not match
        the studio&#39;s
        currency.</p>
    <p>Payouts are scheduled monthly for <em>Free</em> accounts (on the 15th day of the month), every Monday
        for <em>Standard</em> accounts, while <em>Premium</em>
        accounts enjoy daily scheduled payouts.<br>

        To better handle disputes, payments are only released for payout 48 hours after the end of
        the session.<br>
        For example, a payment for a session on April 14th will be transferred on May
        15th for <i>Free</i> plan users, but on the next Monday for <i>Standard</i> plan
        users (if more than 48 hours after the session).
    </p>
    <p>Studio owners are responsible of their own fiscal and accounting obligations regarding to the income
        they receive from
        online payments. </p>
    <p>If you have additional questions about payouts and/or online payments, please reach us at <a
            href="mailto:hello@@noisycamp.com">hello@@noisycamp.com</a>.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="cancellations">Cancellations</h2>

    <p>Bookings are cancellable by customers at any time before the session starts. Customers&#39; online
        payments might be
        refunded depending on the cancellation policy at the time of booking, as fixed by the studio owner.</p>
    <p>Bookings are cancellable by studio owners at any time. Customers&#39; online payments will be entirely
        refunded.
        NoisyCamp reserves the right to charge the applicable transaction fees to the studio owner in case of
        excessive
        cancellations of bookings with online payments.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="disputes">Disputes</h2>

    <p>Customers and studio owners can notify us about a possibly fraudulent studio, booking or online
        payment at <a href="mailto:hello@@noisycamp.com">hello@@noisycamp.com</a>. NoisyCamp reserves
        the right to temporary
        freeze
        the payout of any disputed booking payment. The team at NoisyCamp agrees to do its best to resolve
        the dispute
        while taking into consideration testimonies from all involved parties.</p>
