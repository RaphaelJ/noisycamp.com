    <p>NoisyCamp (&quot;us&quot; or &quot;we&quot;) is providing an online booking management service (the “website” or the
        &quot;service&quot;) for music studios (&quot;studios&quot;), such as rehearsal or recording studios. NoisyCamp is
        operated by Raphael Javaux in Belgium whose company and VAT number is BE 749.513.654.</p>

    <h2 id="booking">Booking</h2>
    
    <p>NoisyCamp provides online services to facilitate the booking of sessions from music studios (&quot;studios&quot;).
    </p>
    <p>NoisyCamp acts as a proxy between the studio and its customers. NoisyCamp, its affiliates or employees disclaim all
        liability for any harm or damage that could occur before, during or after a session. Harm and damage include (but
        are not limited to):</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>damage to any equipment.</li>
        <li>damage to the studio premises.</li>
        <li>harm incurred to the studio business and its profits.</li>
        <li>harm incurred to the physical integrity of the people involved. </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 id="studio-registration">Studio registration</h3>
    
    <p>Studio owners can freely register their music studios through the website. Studio owners are required to provide
        valid and up to date information about their studios (e.g. location, opening times, pricing).</p>
    <p>NoisyCamp reserves the right to remove, without notice, any studio that would not respect the terms of service, or
        that would fail to deliver a quality service to its customers.</p>
    
    <h3 id="online-bookings">Online bookings</h3>
    
    <p>Only registered NoisyCamp users can book studios sessions through the website.</p>
    <p>All bookings will be attributed a unique booking number that will be shared between the customer and the studio
        owner.</p>
    <p>Studio owners will be notified of new booking requests by email, and through the website interface for studio owners.
    </p>
    <p>If the studio owner chooses to not automatically accept bookings, the booking will have to be accepted or rejected
        before the session starts. A booking will be automatically rejected if not accepted before the session starts. Any
        online payment associated with a rejected booking will be automatically refunded.</p>
    
    <h3 id="online-card-payments">Online card payments</h3>
    
    <p>Studio owners can choose to accept online card payments for the bookings placed on their respective studios.</p>
    <p>Online card payments are processed by Stripe Payments Europe, Ltd (&quot;Stripe&quot;), our third-party payment
        partner.</p>
    <p>Studio owners who wish to accept online card payments have to go through the Stripe Connect onboarding process for
        Express accounts. This might include providing some information and documents to verify the studio owner&#39;s
        identity and place of residence.</p>
    <p>The use of online card payments is subject to the <a href="https://stripe.com/en-be/connect-account/legal">Stripe
            Connect terms of service</a>.</p>
    <p>The currency used to complete the payment is determined by the location of the studio. The customer&#39;s bank might
        choose to apply additional currency conversion fee if their bank account does not match the payment currency.</p>
    <p>A transaction fee will be collected on online payments, and subtracted to the studio&#39;s original price. The
        transaction fee equals (@{(Plan.Free.transactionRate * 100).toIntExact}% of the booking total for <em>Free</em>
        accounts, and @{(Plan.Premium.transactionRate * 100).toIntExact}% for <em>Premium</em> accounts. The
        transaction fee is directly charged to the customer by NoisyCamp, and NoisyCamp will take care of any fiscal
        obligations on this transaction fee (e.g. VAT or sale tax). The transaction fee should not appear in studio
        owners&#39; bookkeeping records.</p>
    <p>As an example, a <em>Premium</em> studio owner would observe a $3 transaction fee on a $50 online paid booking, and
        would thus receive a $47 transfer on their bank account. The studio owner would only be responsible of fiscal
        obligations on the received $47 income.</p>
    
    <h4 id="payment-payouts">Payment payouts</h4>
    
    <p>Payments collected through online card payments (minus transaction fees) are accumulated on the studio owner&#39;s
        Stripe account before being transferred to the desired bank account (&quot;payout&quot;). Stripe and the studio
        owner&#39;s bank might apply some additional fees if the bank account&#39;s currency does not match the studio&#39;s
        currency.</p>
    <p>Payouts are scheduled monthly for <em>Free</em> accounts (on the 15th day of the month), while <em>Premium</em>
        accounts enjoy daily scheduled payouts. In both cases, payments are released for payout 48 hours after the end of
        the session. For example, a payment for a session on July 5 will be transferred on July 7 for <em>Premium</em>
        accounts, and July 15 for <em>Free</em> accounts. Additional bank transfer delays might apply.</p>
    <p>Studio owners are responsible of their own fiscal and accounting obligations regarding the income they receive from
        online payments. </p>
    <p>If you have additional questions about payouts and/or online payments, please reach us at <a
            href="mailto:support@@noisycamp.com">support@@noisycamp.com</a>.</p>
    
    <h3 id="cancellations">Cancellations</h3>
    
    <p>Bookings are cancellable by customers at any time before the session starts. Customers&#39; online payments will be
        refunded depending on the cancellation policy at the time of booking, as fixed by the studio owner.</p>
    <p>Bookings are cancellable by studio owners at any time. Customers&#39; online payments will be entirely refunded.
        NoisyCamp reserves the right to charge the applicable transaction fees to the studio owner in case of excessive
        cancellations of bookings with online payments.</p>
    
    <h3 id="disputes">Disputes</h3>
    
    <p>Customers and studio owners can notify us about a possibly fraudulent studio, booking or online payment at <a
            href="mailto:dispute@@noisycamp.com">dispute@@noisycamp.com</a>. NoisyCamp reserves the right to temporary
        freeze
        the payout of any associated booking payment. The team at NoisyCamp agrees to do its best to resolve the dispute
        while taking into consideration testimonies from all involved parties.</p>
