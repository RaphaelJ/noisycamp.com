    <p>At NoisyCamp, we care deeply about the data privacy of our users and studios. We promote full transparency in
        relation to how we collect, handle, secure and store personal data.</p>

    <h2>Collected personal information</h2>

    <p>To operate as expected, our services collect some information about our users. We only collect the information
        required for our services to work properly.</p>
    <p>We collect the following information about our users:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>email addresses.</li>
        <li>first and last names.</li>
        <li>Google or Facebook account IDs for users that use Single Sign-On (SSO) methods.</li>
        <li>dates, durations and payment information about bookings.</li>
        <li>Stripe online transaction IDs associated with online payments.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We do not store passwords but use cryptographic techniques to securely authenticate our users.
        We do not handle or store credit card information, as we delegate this task to our third-party payment provider (see bellow).
    </p>
    <p>In addition, we collect the following information about studios and their owners:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>studio names, locations, phone numbers, opening times, pricing policies, equipments and pictures.</li>
        <li>Stripe account IDs, transaction and payout information if online payments are enabled.</li>
    </ul>
