                <dt>What kind of spaces can be listed on NoisyCamp?</dt>
                <dd>
                    NoisyCamp is a platform designed for spaces that can be used for practicing,
                    recording, mastering, teaching or perform music.

                <dt>Where is NoisyCamp available?</dt>

                <dt>How do online transactions work?</dt>
                <dd>
                    If the studio owner wishes to accept online payments, musicians will be allowed
                    to settle the reservation amount at the time of booking using a valid credit
                    card.<br>
                    The studio owner will then receive that amount directly on their bank account,
                    minus the NoisyCamp transaction fee
                    (@{(Plan.Free.transactionRate * 100).toIntExact}% for <i>Free</i> plan users,
                    @{(Plan.Premium.transactionRate * 100).toIntExact}% for <i>Premium</i> plan
                    users).<br>
                    Payouts to the owner's bank account are done weekly for <i>Premium</i> accounts
                    (every Monday) and monthtly for <i>Free</i> accounts (on the 15th day of the
                    month).<br>
                    To better handle disputes, payments are only released for payout 48 hours after
                    the end of the session.<br>
                    For example, a payment for a session on April 14th will be transferred on May
                    15th for <i>Free</i> plan users, but on the next Monday for <i>Premium</i> plan
                    users (if more than 48 hours after the session).
