                <dt>How do online transactions work?</dt>
                <dd>
                    If the studio owner wishes to accept online payments, musicians will be allowed
                    to settle the reservation amount at the time of the booking using a valid credit
                    card.<br>
                    The studio owner will then receive that amount directly on their bank account,
                    minus the NoisyCamp service fee
                    (@{(Plan.Free.transactionRate * 100).toIntExact}% for <i>Free</i> plan users,
                    @{(Plan.Premium.transactionRate * 100).toIntExact}% for <i>Premium</i> plan
                    users).<br>
                    Payouts to the owner's bank account are done daily for <i>Premium</i> accounts
                    and monthtly for <i>Free</i> accounts (on the 15th day of the month).
                    Payments are released for payout 48 hours after the end of the session. <br>
                    For example, a payment for a session on June 24th will be transferred on June
                    26th for <i>Premium</i> plan users but on July 15th for <i>Free</i> plan users.
